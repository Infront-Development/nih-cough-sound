                            <strong>PURPOSE:</strong><br>
                            In this study we will collect sample breath and cough sounds from healthy individuals, COVID-19 patients and other infectious diseases,
                            and try to distinguish them using an Artificial Intelligence. Total number of participants is estimated to be 2400 for each type of disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <strong>STUDY PROCEDURES:</strong><br>
                            You will submit breath and cough data using website audio recordings that will start once you give your consent to participate by
                            clicking next, and will answer seven questions about yourself:
                            (1) Category of respondent
                            (2) Sex
                            (3) Age
                            (4) Medical conditions
                            (5) Smoking status
                            (6) Symptoms
                            (7) Date of diagnosis or test
                            The total participation time should be around 10 minutes.
                            You will record your breath and cough sound using the recording capability in this website and the sound will be captured and sent to
                            the study team for the use only for the purpose of research.
                            At the end of the recording, we will get for your approximate location as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <strong>RISK, PRECAUTIONS & POTENTIAL DISCOMFORT:</strong><br>
                            Make sure no other persons are within 20 feet of you when recording your breath and cough. Make sure you are away from any source
                            of noises to avoid unclear or contaminated recordings. You may experience minimal discomfort when producing cough. However, this
                            will not cause any harm to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>POTENTIAL BENEFITS:</strong><br>
                            In participating in this research study, you will contribute to solving a very important world problem. Eventually, your participation will
                            contribute to the development of an automated infectious diseases screening web tool.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>CONFIDENTIALITY & PRIVACY:</strong><br>
                            Information from you will be limited to breath and cough recordings and answers to the seven questions. All data from the study will
                            be stored in a secure local data server where they will be protected with encryption at all times, only accessible to participating
                            researchers and organizations. We will keep a repository of the data after the study is completed so that we can use it for development
                            of similar Artificial Intelligence, for example, if another pandemic appears in the future.
        
                            Please after youâ€™ve read all the information in this consent form, ask any questions via email to Law Kian Boon (dhri@crc.gov.my), the
                            Principal Coordinating Investigator about anything you do not understand before deciding whether or not to participate. There is no
                            compensation for participating in this study. You are not waiving any legal rights because of your participation in this research study.

                            If you decide to participate, in the next page we will ask you to send your breath and cough sound after you enter answers to the seven
                            questions mentioned above. You will submit the breath and cough sound through the speaker of your mobile phone, laptop or
                            computer
